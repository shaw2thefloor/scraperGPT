The wild-type A. thaliana (ecotypes Col-0) was used for root scRNA-seq
experiments. Seeds were sterilized with 15% bleach and germinated on
vertical half-strength Murashige and Skoog (1/2 MS) plates (2.21 g of
MS basal medium with vitamin powder and 8 g/l agar, pH 5.7) at 21C
(day)/19C (night) in long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark, with a light
intensity of 80 mmol/m2
/s using Philips TLD 36W/865 and 36W/830
bulbs). The root tissues were harvested after 10 days of growth. arr1-3,
arr2-4, arr1-3 arr10-5, arr2-4 arr12-1, arr1-3 arr10-5, arr12-1, pDR5:GFP,
and pTCSn:GFP were described previously (Sabatini et al., 1999; Leibfried
et al., 2005; Mason et al., 2005; Zurcher et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2017).
For root phenotypic assays, the seeds were sterilized and germinated
on 1/2 MS vertical plates.
Preparation of Root Samples for scRNA-seq
The root tip regions (0.5 cm in length from root tip) were harvested and digested for 2 h at room temperature in RNase-free enzyme solution (1.5%
cellulase R10, 1.5% macerozyme R10, 0.4 M mannitol, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM
CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA). The protoplasts were filtered with a cell strainer
(40 mm diameter, Falcon #352340), concentrated, and washed three to
four times with 8% mannitol at room temperature. Protoplast viability
was determined by trypan blue staining, with the ratio of viable cells being
more than 85%. The concentration of protoplasts was adjusted to 1500â€“
2000 cells/ml. The cells were then processed with the 10xGenomics Single
Cell Protocol (CG00052, RevC).
scRNA-Seq Library Construction and Sequencing
Approximately 15 000 counted cells were loaded on Single Cell A Chip.
The libraries were constructed using Chromium Controller and Chromium
Single Cell 30 Reagent Kits v2. In brief, cell suspensions in a chip were
loaded on a Chromium Controller (10xGenomics, Pleasanton, CA) to
generate single-cell GEMs (gel beads in emulsion). scRNA-seq libraries
were then prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 30 Gel Bead and Library Kit (P/N #120236, 120237, 120262; 10xGenomics). Qualitative analysis of DNA library was performed by an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The
concentration of DNA library was measured by Qubit (Invitrogen). Libraries
were sequenced by an Illumina NovaSeq sequencer (Genergy Biotechnology Shanghai). The raw scRNA-seq dataset comprised Read1,
Read2, and i7 index read. The 26-bp read length of Read1 contained
the sequence of the 16 bp 10xBarcode and 10 bp UMI (unique molecular
identifiers). The 98-bp read length of Read2 was the sequence of the
cDNA fragment. In total, 317 339 569 reads were obtained.
