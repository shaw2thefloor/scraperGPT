Using the same markers as in the previous scRNA-seq analysis, we identified 10 different clusters and established profiles of the lateral plate mesoderm, neural tissue, early somite, maturing somite, ectoderm, blood, endothelial, tailbud, notochord and neural crest cells (Fig. 3). Spatial patterns of localised anterior-to-posterior restricted gene expression were evident for all tissue types, with exception of the ectoderm, suggesting that this tissue has few distinguishing markers along the A-P axis. In the most posterior samples, we identified blood (Hbm, Hba1) and endothelial marker genes (Lmo2, Ramp2), consistent with this region comprising extra-embryonic tissue. Subsequent sections showed the onset of tailbud genes (T (= brachyury) and Fgf8). Some notochord markers were more highly expressed in posterior sections (Shh), while transferrin (Tf) was expressed along the axis, with lower levels around the tailbud region. Across neural tissue (Ckb, Pax6), early somites (Meox1, Tcf15) and maturing somites (Cnmd, Shisa2), gene expression profiles showed a gradual increase towards the anterior. Neural crest cells are beginning to migrate and become distinguishable in the more anterior sections with discreet profiles detected for Foxd3 and Sox10 (Fig. 3C).
